# Des Moines Bikesharing

This project was an analysis to explore the creation of a bikesharing company in Des Moines.  Data was used from a similar business model in NYC to attempt to understand what to expect.

### Population Comparison

| NEW YORK CITY | DES MOINES |
| ------------- | ---------- |
| 8,398,748     | 216,853    |

We see that Des Moines has a population of 2.6% the size of New York City.

### Customers vs. Population

By reviewing the Citibike data for NYC, we saw that 5.3% of the city's population were users and 22.6% of the city's population were subscribers.

### Des Moines Expectation

If we assume that a similar ratio of the Des Moines population will become customers of a bikesharing company, then we would expect to see 11,460 users and 49,067 subscribers.

### Further Analysis

Before determining if a bikesharing company would be profitable in Des Moines, we would need to do further analysis on whether the above number of customers would cover maintenance and other costs of doing business in this city.
